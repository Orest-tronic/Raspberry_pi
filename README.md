# Raspberry_pi
This file is about a line follower robot that uses a Pi camera to set the path and its trajectory.
It also uses a PID controler to improve its movementwith hight accurancy, but before that notice that i'm using the RRB3 module
so to control the motors you just have to download first the library or just manage with the motor shield that you have.
For another accurancy, ajust the resolution if you wan the robot to be more fast (reduce the resolution of the image on the screen).
